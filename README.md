It contains the LaTeX source, diagrams, appendices, and supplementary materials that develop **CIO**, a pre-geometric epistemic framework where information and causal structure precede geometry and physical law.

## 📌 Overview

**Causal Informational Ordering (CIO)** is a framework that starts from two minimal epistemic assumptions:

1. **Distinguishable configurations** (`Σ`),  
2. **Lawful transitions** between them (`T ⊆ Σ × Σ`).

From these alone, we derive:

### 🕒 Emergent Time  
Time is defined as the **partial order** generated by transitions:
